# Galasa Internal Integration Tests

The integration tests in this subproject depend on an Galasa provisioning manager hosted within IBM to exercise certain managers, including the CICS TS and SDV managers.

As a result, these tests can only be run internally until an open source equivalent of the provisioning manager is created.
